# Java Data Structures Project

This Java project is a collection of various data structure implementations, aiming to help developers and learners in
understanding and using these fundamental concepts in their applications. The project currently includes the following
data structures:

- Doubly Linked List
- Singly Linked List
- Stack (Linked List implementation)
- Stack (Array implementation)
- Queue (Linked List implementation)
- Queue (Array implementation)
- Max Heap (Array implementation)
- Min Heap (Array implementation)
- Binary Search Tree Implementation

Additional data structures will be added in the future to further expand the project's utility.
